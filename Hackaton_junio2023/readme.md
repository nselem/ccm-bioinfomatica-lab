## Submission Requirements


- All research submitted to CAMDA must be previously unpublished original work intended for publication, including procedures and results.
- Challenge data set embargo: Any challenge data that is not already in the public domain remains exclusive for participants in the contest until conference presentation. This means that no publication of your results is allowed prior to the CAMDA conference. Once research has been accepted for publication at CAMDA, however, dissemination by pre-print servers is fine and encouraged.
- Research introducing data sets outside the set CAMDA challenges need to put these data in the context of the challenges and make both raw and derived data publicly available if the submitted work is accepted.
- Methods research needs to include at least two independent types of validation, such as a benchmark on simulated data with known truth, a benchmark on real-world data with built-in truths, or an application to real-world data with critical biological / medical interpretation.
- Researchers introducing novel computational approaches must make their procedure available to others (e.g., source code or commercial demo), and a publication of source code is strongly encouraged.


## Anti-Microbial Resistance Prediction and Forensics
Antimicrobial resistance is one of the biggest challenges facing modern medicine. Because the management of COVID-19 was increasingly becoming dependent on pharmacological interventions, there is greater risk for accelerating the evolution and spread of antimicrobial resistance [1]. A study in a tertiary hospital environment revealed concerning colonisation patterns of microbes during extended periods [2]. It also highlighted the diversity of antimicrobial resistance gene reservoirs in hospitals that could facilitate the emergence and transmission of new modes of antibiotic resistance. This year we would like CAMDA community to look into AMR related challenges.

The goal will be to explore a metagenomic surveillance data from a selection of about 400 samples provided by MetaSUB International Consortium collected during global City Sampling Day 2016 and 2017 in several cities in US (Baltimore, Denver, Mineapollis, New York, Sacramento, San Antonio) and worldwide (Berlin, Bogota, Doha, Ilorin, Lisbon, Sao Paulo, Tokyo, Vienna, Zurich) to trace the AMR patterns.

A focus should be placed especially on AMR markers and resistance groups identified in about 150 isolates from hospital in one of abovementioned US cities collected in similar time. Can you tell which one?
As it was shown in the past CAMDA challenges an antibiotic resistance as functional biomarkers can accurately predict the origin of urban metagenomics samples.

Of course, you are welcome to use your imagination to carry out any side analysis that you would like, using the provided datasets. That is why we do provide, in addition as a non-urban context, a selection of soil microbiome samples from EMP500 project can be used.
