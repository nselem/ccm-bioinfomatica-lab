We discovered that from the 505 AMR Ids markers from the misterious file only 180 were predicted using CARD v.XX over the assembled reads from US cities.  To comprehend the missing 325 markers we gathered our own [manually curated AMR gene list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ThsVn6QuIEPvFqe_SwG1PawEghqHgQdvNgGiZd40jXY/edit?usp=sharing)
 by searching the IDs in the following databases 
- [microbigg-e](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pathogens/microbigge/#)  
- [CARD](https://card.mcmaster.ca/)    
- [bv-brc](https://www.bv-brc.org/view/SpecialtyGeneList/)    
- [pathogenes-refgene](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pathogens/refgene/)   
- [NCBI-gene](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene)
