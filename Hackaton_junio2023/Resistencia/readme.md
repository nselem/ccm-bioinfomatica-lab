We discovered that from the XX AMR markers from the misterious file onlye XX were predicted using CARD vXX over the assembled reads from US cities.  To comprehend the missing ~400 markers we gathered our own [manually curated AMR gene list(https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ThsVn6QuIEPvFqe_SwG1PawEghqHgQdvNgGiZd40jXY/edit?usp=sharing)
 by searching the IDs in the following databases 
- [microbigg-e](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pathogens/microbigge/#)  
- [CARD](https://card.mcmaster.ca/)    
- [bv-brc](https://www.bv-brc.org/view/SpecialtyGeneList/)    
- [pathogenes-refgene](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pathogens/refgene/)
